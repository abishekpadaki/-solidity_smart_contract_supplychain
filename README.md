# Solidity Application For a Supply-Chain on the Etheruem Blockchain
A Supply chain application built using Smart Contracts written in Solidity and executed on the Etheruem Blockchain Network.
Pre-requisites:
1) Truffle (download Truffle npm package using `npm install -g truffle`)
2) An Ethereum Wallet as a browser extension (eg. Metamask)

Steps:
1) First we need to migrate and deploy the smart contracts. Use the command `truffle develop` at the root to do this.
2) Once done, on a new terminal go to the `client` directory and run the command `npm start` to start the React Server on localhost:3000
3) Connect your metamask account with the application when asked and use the application.

Real-World Use-Case for this Project:
1) Can be part of a supply-chain solution
2) Automated Dispatch upon payment
3) Payment collection without middlemen

This project was done as a part of the course ["Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity (2021)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-developer/) on Udemy
